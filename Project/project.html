            <p>Hey, my name is Ahmed and I'm a 16-year-old high school student. I've always been passionate about startups and financial literacy, and I've attended mentorship sessions to gain more knowledge in these fields. I believe that startups are the future and can help drive economic growth and development.
                I'm also into digital marketing, coding, and game development. I've created a few games that have been well-received by my peers & i've also participated in an online game jam in 2020. I have a keen eye for design and user experience, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.</p>
            <p>Volunteering also plays a decent role of my life. I've worked with organizations such as Resala to give back to my community. I'm also heavily involved in student activities, and was once part of a team called Science Land that promotes science and technology to young students.
                Today, I'm proud to be an ambassador at OBM Education, where I help empower young people with the skills they need to succeed in life.
                Overall, I'm driven by my passion to make a difference in the world. I'm constantly seeking new ways to improve myself and those around me, and I believe that with hard work and dedication, I can make a positive impact on the world.</p>

                    I am proficient in web design and game development, with a keen eye for aesthetics and user experience. I have also participated in various competitions and events, including the NASA Space Apps challenge where I was part of the programming team. This experience helped me hone my problem-solving skills and work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.
                    
                    As a natural leader, I am able to take charge and lead a team effectively. I believe in creating a positive and collaborative work environment that brings out the best in everyone. My strong communication and public speaking skills also enable me to articulate ideas and convey messages effectively to a wide range of audiences.
                    
                    In summary, my skills in web design and game development, along with my experience in competitions and events, demonstrate my ability to work effectively in teams and contribute positively to any project or organization. My leadership abilities and communication skills further enhance my value as a team player and an effective collaborator.</p>
